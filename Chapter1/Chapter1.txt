Atoms are used as names of individual and predicates. Atom begins with a lowercase letter and can contains, letters ,digits, and the underscore mark(_).
Structure normally consists of an atom, an opening parenthesis, one or more arguments separated by commas, and a closing parenthesis. 
 // An atom by itself is a structure with no arguments.
 
 In the strucutre, the atom at the begining is called, FUNCTOR. 
 :- is an Infix Operator. It normally written between its arguments.

 in_out_: atom; 'X'(XX) : structure; 'X':atom
